<h1>Odin Project Landing Page</h1>

I originally set out for this to be a 1:1 copy of the original stylesheet from The Odin Project Landing Page project, but decided to dive into responsive design while still attempting to stay true to as much of the original stylesheet as possible.

<h2>Where I differed from the original stylesheet</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Utlilizing vh & vw instead of px for box & image sizing.</li>
    <li>For text sizing I used utopia.fyi for responsive text elements and implemented them using the css font-size: var() function.</li>
    <li>Also included meta tags in the HTML header for social media optimization; including an image card, twitter card, preview image, title, & description.</li>
</ul>
