<h1>Odin Project Landing Page</h1>

I originally set out for this to be a 1:1 copy of the original stylesheet from The Odin Project Landing Page project, but decided to dive into responsive design while still attempting to stay true to as much of the original stylesheet as possible.

<h2>Where I differed from the original stylesheet</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Utlilizing vh & vw instead of px for box & image sizing.</li>
    <li>For text sizing I used <a href="https://utopia.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">utopia.fyi</a> for responsive text elements and implemented them using the css font-size: var() function.</li>
    <li>Also included meta tags in the HTML header for social media optimization; including an image card, twitter card, preview image, title, & description.</li>
</ul>
<p>While all of this works and I had fun going deeper into CSS functions, I would not consider it a fully optimized site for desktop & mobile. The text is not accessibility compliant and does not respond to zooming on mobile devices.</p>
<p>I also intentionally decided to attempt this without using media queries and implementing fully unique designs for mobile, tablet, & desktop viewing in order to stick with the original spirit of this exercise.</p>
